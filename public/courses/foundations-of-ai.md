### Session 1: Is It REALLY Intelligent? Let's Find Out! üåü

#### Opening Circle: What's Your AI Superpower?
*Time: 15 minutes*

Let's kick things off! Find a circle with your team and answer these questions:
1.  **Your AI Suspect:** Name one gadget or app you think is secretly an AI. What's your evidence?
2.  **Your Burning Question:** What's one mystery about AI you want to solve this week?
3.  **Your AI Dream:** If you could invent any AI, what superpower would it have to help people?

Your teacher will be like a detective's chief, gathering all the clues and ideas on the board!

#### The Great AI Mystery: Cracking the Code on "Artificial Intelligence" üîç
*Time: 25 minutes*

Ready to crack the code? The secret to understanding "Artificial Intelligence" is hidden in those two words!

**Part 1: What does "Artificial" mean?**
Think like a detective:
-   If a flower is **Natural**, where does it come from? (Nature!)
-   If a plastic flower is **Artificial**, who made it? (People!)

So, **Artificial = Made by Humans.**

**Hands-on Challenge: The Natural vs. Artificial Sort!**
*Your teacher has a pile of evidence. Your team's job is to sort it into two piles: "Natural" and "Artificial."*
-   Work together! Some items are tricky. Is a wooden chair natural or artificial? What's your reasoning?
-   **Big Discovery:** Things can be a mix! This is a great clue for how AI works, too‚Äîit's intelligence *created by humans*.

**Part 2: What is "Intelligence"?**
This one's about brainpower! What does it mean to be smart?
-   It's the power to **learn** new things.
-   It's the power to **solve problems**.
-   It's the power to **adapt** when things change.

**The Brain Power Challenge:**
Your brain is an amazing intelligence machine! Let's test it.
1.  **Problem-Solving:** Your teacher has a puzzle. How does your team work together to solve it?
2.  **Learning:** Your teacher will teach you a secret pattern. How many tries does it take for you to master it?
3.  **Adapting:** What happens when the pattern suddenly changes? Can you adapt without missing a beat?

You just proved you have intelligence! Now, the big question is... can we teach a machine to do the same things?

**Quick Knowledge Check!**
*You're an AI Detective at a tech fair. Which of these inventions shows true artificial intelligence?*
A) A toaster that always toasts for 2 minutes.
B) A music app that learns what you like and suggests new songs.
C) A bike that moves faster when you pedal harder.

*Answer: B! Why? Because the music app is LEARNING and ADAPTING to you. The others are just following simple, programmed rules.*

#### Intelligence Everywhere: The Super-Sensor Challenge üëÅÔ∏èüëÇ‚úã
*Time: 20 minutes*

How does your brain know what's happening? It uses sensors: your eyes, ears, and hands! AI uses sensors, too (like cameras and microphones). Let's test your built-in sensors!

*Rotate through these 5 stations and see how powerful your brain is!*

**Station 1: Eye-Spy Intelligence**
-   Can you guess the mystery objects just by peeking through a tiny hole?
-   **Detective Question:** How does your brain "fill in the blanks" to guess the object?

**Station 2: Super-Hearing Intelligence**
-   Listen to the mystery sounds. Can you name them all?
-   **Detective Question:** What clues in the sound help you figure out what it is?

**Station 3: Touch-Detective Intelligence**
-   No peeking! Can you identify the objects in the bag just by touch?
-   **Detective Question:** How does your brain connect the *feeling* of an object to a *memory* of that object?

**Station 4: Pattern-Spotting Intelligence**
-   Red-Blue-Red-Blue... What comes next? Why is that so easy for your brain?
-   **Detective Question:** Where else do you see patterns in your day?

**Station 5: Puzzle-Master Intelligence**
-   Solve the brain-teasers!
-   **Detective Question:** What different strategies did your brain try to solve the puzzle?

**Team Debrief:** Think about it: did you have to consciously think about how to do these things, or did your brain just... do it? That's what we want to teach computers!

#### AI Detective Work: Is Your Home a Smart Home? üè†
*Time: 25 minutes*

Let's go on an imaginary hunt for AI in a place you know well‚Äîyour home!

**Part 1: Where is the AI hiding?**
With a partner, brainstorm the AI in each room. Ask yourselves: "What does it learn?"
-   **Living Room:** How does a game console get better at playing against you? How does a TV recommend shows?
-   **Kitchen:** How would a smart fridge *know* what recipes to suggest? What would it need to learn?
-   **Your Phone:** How does your phone's keyboard predict your next word? How does it sort your photos?

**Part 2: Spot the Fakes!**
Just because it plugs in doesn't mean it's smart. Can you spot the non-AI "imposters"?
-   A toaster: Does it learn how you like your toast, or just follow a timer?
-   A light switch: Does it learn when you're in the room, or just wait for you to flip it?
-   A bicycle: Who's doing the balancing, steering, and learning? The bike, or you?

**The Golden Question for any AI Detective:** "Does it LEARN and ADAPT, or just follow the same rules every time?"

**Quick Knowledge Check!**
*You're comparing an AI smart speaker to a regular radio. What is the single biggest clue that the speaker is using AI?*
A) The smart speaker is newer.
B) The smart speaker can learn from your requests and change its behavior.
C) The radio can play music louder.

*Answer: B! An AI learns and adapts. A regular machine just repeats its programming.*

---

#### The Great AI Scavenger Hunt üîç
*Time: 20 minutes*

Time for the ultimate challenge! Your teacher has a deck of cards with pictures of different gadgets and systems.
*Your team's mission: Sort them into "AI" and "Not AI" piles as fast as you can!*

**The Rules:**
1.  Work as a team to decide where each card goes.
2.  For every card you put in the "AI" pile, you must be able to answer: **"What does it learn?"**
3.  For every "Not AI" card, you must be able to answer: **"What are its simple rules?"**
4.  Get ready for some tricky ones! A simple calculator isn't AI, but an app that solves math problems from a photo IS! Why?

**Team Debrief:**
-   Which cards caused the most debate in your team? Why?
-   Did you find any that could be AI *sometimes* but not others?
-   **Big Discovery:** The line between a simple program and a true AI can be blurry! It all comes down to whether it can learn.

## Week 2: AI Detective Training - Part 2

### Session 2: The Learning Revolution - Smart vs. Programmed üß†‚ö°

#### Opening Story: "The Tale of Two Robots" üìñ
*Time: 15 minutes*

**Interactive Storytelling**: Get ready to make some predictions!

*"Once upon a time, in a busy school, there were two robot helpers: Rusty and Sparky.*

*Rusty was a **Programmed** robot. He knew exactly three rules:*
1. *When the bell rings, say 'Time for class!'*
2. *When you see a book on the floor, pick it up.*
3. *When you see paper scraps, sweep them up.*

*Rusty was great at his job. But one day... a student dropped a whole bowl of spaghetti! Rusty saw the mess and tried to sweep it. It just made things worse! He couldn't learn a new way to clean.*

**Question:** Why did Rusty fail? What would a human have done differently?

*Then came Sparky, the **AI** robot. Sparky was designed to learn. When he saw the spaghetti, he:*
1. *Scanned the mess to identify it.*
2. *Searched his memory for "liquid spill cleanup" procedures.*
3. *Figured out a new strategy using a mop and sponge.*
4. *Most importantly, he remembered this for next time!*

**Discussion Questions**:
- "What's the real difference between Sparky and Rusty?"
- "Can you think of a time you had to adapt when your 'usual rules' didn't work?"

---

#### The Ultimate Challenge: Calculator vs. AI Assistant üî¢ü§ñ
*Time: 30 minutes*

Let's see this in action! With a partner, grab a calculator and a device with an AI assistant. Time for a head-to-head battle!

**Round 1: The Simple Math Test**
-   **Challenge**: Ask both: "What is 127 + 89?"
-   **Result**: Both get it right! So far, they both seem "smart." But are they?

**Round 2: The Context Test**
-   **Challenge**: Ask both: "I have $10. An apple costs $1.50. How many can I buy?"
-   **Calculator**: Can it understand the question? Or can it only do `10 / 1.5` if you type it in?
-   **AI Assistant**: Can it understand the *context* of your question and give you the answer?
-   **Detective's Finding**: AI understands context, not just numbers!

**Round 3: The Learning Test**
-   **Challenge**: Tell the AI assistant, "My favorite animal is a penguin." Then ask it, "What animal should I draw?"
-   **Calculator**: Can it remember what you like?
-   **AI Assistant**: Does it remember your preference and make a good suggestion?
-   **Detective's Finding**: AI can learn about YOU!

**Round 4: The Adaptation Test**
-   **Challenge**: Ask the AI the same thing in three different ways:
    - "What's the weather like?"
  - "Will it rain today?"
  - "Should I bring an umbrella?"
-   **Detective's Finding**: AI can adapt to different ways of asking the same thing!

**Quick Knowledge Check!**
*What is the key ability that makes an AI "smarter" than a calculator?*
A) It uses electricity.
B) It can learn from experience and understand context.
C) It can do math very quickly.

*Answer: B! A calculator is a powerful tool, but it only follows programmed rules. An AI learns and adapts.*

---

#### Rule-Following vs. Learning: The "If-Then" Game üéØ
*Time: 25 minutes*

**Part 1: You're a Programmed Robot!**
Let's see what it's like to be Rusty. With your team, write down 5 simple "If-Then" rules for your robot self.
-   **If** my stomach rumbles, **then** I eat a snack.
-   **If** the clock says 9 PM, **then** I go to bed.

Now, let's find the bugs! What could go wrong with these simple rules?
-   *What if you just finished a huge dinner and your stomach rumbles? Should you still eat a snack?*
-   *What if it's 9 PM but you're not tired at all?*
-   **Discovery**: Simple rules don't work for a complex world!

**Part 2: You're an AI!**
Now, upgrade your robot! Instead of simple rules, how would an AI handle these situations?
-   **Scenario**: Your stomach rumbles.
-   **AI Thinking Process**: "My stomach rumbled. **When was the last time I ate?** Was it a big meal? **How do I feel physically?** Okay, I'll wait 30 minutes and see if I'm still hungry."

**Challenge:** How would an AI decide when to go to bed? What "data" would it use to make a smart decision instead of just following a clock?

## Week 3: How Computers See - The Visual Intelligence Revolution üëÅÔ∏è

Dive deep into the fascinating world of computer vision! This week, you'll discover how computers "see" and recognize images, explore the challenges of visual perception, and conduct hands-on experiments to understand how AI processes visual information.

### üéØ Learning Objectives:
By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Explain how computer vision differs from human vision
- Identify the key factors that affect image recognition (lighting, angles, clarity)
- Analyze what features make objects recognizable to both humans and computers
- Demonstrate understanding of how computers learn to recognize patterns in images
- Create and test simple image classification systems
- Evaluate the challenges and limitations of computer vision technology

### Session 1: The Great Vision Challenge - Eyes vs. Digital Eyes üëÅÔ∏èüì∑

#### Opening Mystery: The Case of the Confused Computer üîç
*Time: 15 minutes*

**Story Setup**: "Last week, a new AI system was installed at the local zoo to help identify animals for visitors. But something went wrong! The AI kept making silly mistakes - it called a zebra a 'striped horse,' couldn't recognize a penguin in the water, and thought a sleeping lion was a 'big rock.' What went wrong?"

**Student Predictions**: 
- Students work in pairs to hypothesize what might have caused these errors
- Share theories with the class
- **Key Question**: "How is computer vision different from human vision?"

#### The Vision Laboratory: How Do We See? üß™
*Time: 30 minutes*

**Experiment 1: The Partial Picture Challenge**
*Materials: 20 images with portions covered by paper*

**Setup**: Students rotate through stations with partially hidden images
- **Station A**: Only show 25% of familiar objects (car, dog, house)
- **Station B**: Show objects from unusual angles (chair from underneath, bicycle from above)
- **Station C**: Show objects in unusual lighting (shadows, bright backlighting)
- **Station D**: Show objects with similar shapes but different purposes (baseball vs. orange, both round)

**Student Task**: Identify each object and rate confidence (1-5 scale)

**Results Discussion**:
- "Which images were easiest/hardest to identify?"
- "How did your brain fill in missing information?"
- "What clues did you use when you couldn't see the whole object?"

**Key Discovery**: Human vision is incredibly sophisticated - we use context, memory, and reasoning to identify objects even with limited information!

**Multiple Choice Check**:
*Why do computers need clear, well-lit images to recognize objects?*
A) Computers don't have eyes like humans do
B) Blurry or poorly lit images don't contain enough visual pattern information for computers to identify objects
C) Computer cameras are more expensive than human eyes
D) Clear images look prettier on computer screens

*Answer: B - Computers identify objects by finding patterns in visual data, which requires clear, detailed information*

*Explanation: Unlike humans who can use reasoning and context, computers rely entirely on the visual patterns they can detect in an image. Poor lighting or blur removes the detailed patterns computers need to make accurate identifications.*

#### The Angle Investigation: Same Object, Different Views üîÑ
*Time: 25 minutes*

**The 360-Degree Challenge**

**Setup**: 
- 5 common objects (chair, backpack, water bottle, book, shoe)
- Each object photographed from 8 different angles (front, back, left, right, top, bottom, close-up, far away)

**Round 1: Human Recognition Test**
- Students view all angles of one object in random order
- Task: Group photos that show the same object
- **Discovery**: Humans are excellent at recognizing objects from any angle!

**Round 2: Computer Perspective Simulation**
- Students pretend to be computers with no prior knowledge
- Given only ONE reference photo per object
- Must identify the same object from different angles using ONLY visual pattern matching
- **Challenge**: Much harder when you can only compare visual patterns!

**Multiple Choice Check**:
*Why do we need to show computers objects from multiple angles during training?*
A) To make the training process take longer
B) Because computers can only remember one angle at a time
C) So the computer can recognize the object even when viewed from angles it hasn't seen before
D) Because multiple angles make the images look more interesting

*Answer: C - Training with multiple angles helps computers recognize objects from any viewpoint*

*Explanation: If we only train a computer with front-view photos of cars, it might not recognize a car photographed from the side or back. Variety in training data helps AI generalize to new situations.*

#### Face Recognition: How Computers See You üòä
*Time: 20 minutes*

**Demo**: Face Recognition Technology
*Using tablets/phones with face recognition or apps like Snapchat filters*

**Activity 1: Feature Detection**
- Students use face filter apps to see how computers identify facial features
- **Observe**: How does the computer track eyes, nose, mouth?
- **Experiment**: What happens when you cover different parts of your face?

**Activity 2: The Human Face Map**
- Students work in pairs to identify facial features that make each person unique
- Create simple drawings highlighting: eye shape, nose shape, face shape, etc.
- **Discussion**: "What features would a computer need to tell people apart?"

**Activity 3: Fooling Face Recognition**
- **Experiment**: Try to confuse face recognition with:
  - Sunglasses
  - Hats
  - Different facial expressions
  - Different lighting
  - Covering parts of the face

**Results & Discussion**:
- "When did face recognition work best/worst?"
- "What does this tell us about how computers 'see' faces?"
- "How is this different from how you recognize your friends?"

### Session 2: Becoming Computer Vision Detectives üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### The Feature Detective Challenge: What Makes a Cat a Cat? üê±
*Time: 35 minutes*

**Phase 1: Human Pattern Recognition**
*Materials: 15 photos of different cats (various breeds, colors, poses)*

**Activity**: Students examine all cat photos and create a "Cat Feature List"
- **Individual Work** (5 minutes): Each student lists what makes these images "cats"
- **Small Group Synthesis** (10 minutes): Groups combine lists and prioritize features
- **Class Discussion** (10 minutes): Create master list on board

**Typical Student Discoveries**:
- Pointed ears
- Whiskers
- Tail
- Four legs
- Fur
- Cat-shaped eyes
- Size/proportions

**Phase 2: The Computer Challenge**
**Activity**: Now students must think like computers - only visual patterns matter!

**Challenge Questions**:
- "What if the cat is black and the background is dark?" (contrast issues)
- "What if you can only see the cat's face?" (partial information)
- "What if the cat is a hairless breed?" (missing expected features)
- "What about a stuffed toy cat?" (similar visual patterns, different object)

**Multiple Choice Check**:
*What's the most important principle when creating training examples for computer vision?*
A) All examples should look exactly the same
B) Examples should show variety while maintaining the key identifying features
C) Only use professional photographs
D) Include as many examples as possible, regardless of quality

*Answer: B - Examples should show variety while maintaining the key identifying features*

*Explanation: Good training data shows an object in many different conditions (lighting, angles, backgrounds) while always maintaining the core features that define that object. This helps the computer learn what's essential versus what's just circumstantial.*

#### The Google Quick Draw Challenge üé®
*Time: 25 minutes*

**Activity Setup**: Students use Google's "Quick, Draw!" AI game
*Website: quickdraw.withgoogle.com*

**Round 1: Standard Challenge** (10 minutes)
- Students play the game normally
- Try drawing: cat, tree, house, bicycle, airplane, fish
- **Observe**: When does the AI guess correctly vs. incorrectly?

**Round 2: Scientific Testing** (15 minutes)
Students conduct controlled experiments:

**Experiment A: Detail Level**
- Draw the same object (e.g., house) three ways:
  1. Very simple (just basic shape)
  2. Medium detail (windows, door)
  3. Lots of detail (decorations, landscaping)
- **Question**: Which level of detail works best?

**Experiment B: Drawing Style**
- Draw the same object in different styles:
  1. Realistic proportions
  2. Cartoon style
  3. Abstract/geometric
- **Question**: Does drawing style affect recognition?

**Class Discussion & Analysis**:
- "What patterns did you notice in when the AI succeeded vs. failed?"
- "How is the AI's recognition similar to or different from human recognition?"

#### Introduction to Teachable Machine: Our First AI Trainer Experience ü§ñ
*Time: 30 minutes*

**Demo Introduction**: Teacher demonstrates Google's Teachable Machine
*Website: teachablemachine.withgoogle.com*

**Whole-Class Training Session**: "Apples vs. Oranges"

**Phase 1: Data Collection Strategy** (10 minutes)
- **Class Discussion**: "What makes a good training photo?"
- **Planning**: Students suggest what variety to include:
  - Different types of apples (red, green, yellow)
  - Different angles and lighting
  - Different backgrounds
  - Different sizes and conditions

**Phase 2: Live Training** (15 minutes)
- **Collect Examples**: Use classroom camera/phones to take 10-15 photos of each fruit
- **Upload & Label**: Add photos to Teachable Machine categories
- **Train Model**: Click "Train" and watch the progress
- **Class Observation**: "What is the computer doing right now?"

**Phase 3: Testing & Analysis** (5 minutes)
- **Test with New Images**: Try fruits not used in training
- **Analyze Results**: Discuss accuracy and confidence levels
- **Identify Failures**: What images confused the AI and why?

**Multiple Choice Check**:
*What happens when we give an AI more diverse training examples?*
A) It gets confused by too much information
B) It becomes more accurate at recognizing objects in different conditions
C) It runs slower and uses more memory
D) It only remembers the last examples it saw

*Answer: B - It becomes more accurate at recognizing objects in different conditions*

*Explanation: Diverse training examples help AI learn the essential features of an object while ignoring irrelevant details like background or lighting. This makes the AI more robust and accurate when encountering new images.*

#### Real-World Computer Vision Hunt üîç
*Time: 15 minutes*

**Activity**: Students identify computer vision applications in their daily lives

**Brainstorming Session**:

#### The Pet Detector Failure Stories
**Story 1**: "Morgan's Pet Detector worked perfectly in testing. But at the animal rescue, it kept misidentifying stressed, thin rescue dogs as cats, and scared, matted cats as 'unknown animals.' Morgan realized they'd never considered what pets look like when they're not happy and healthy."

**Story 2**: "Casey's AI was confidently wrong about obvious pets. When shown a clear golden retriever photo, it declared 'DEFINITELY A CAT - 94% confident!' Casey focused so much on making the AI sound certain that they forgot to ask whether confidence without accuracy actually helps anyone."

**Critical Thinking Framework Application**:
- **Clarity**: What specific failures occurred? What assumptions led to these failures?
- **Accuracy**: How could we verify if these problems are real?
- **Precision**: Could we be more specific about which types of failures matter most?

**Key Question**: "How do we systematically identify and understand AI problems that affect real people?"

#### Systematic Problem Investigation
**Empathy Interview Protocol**: Students interview each other about AI experiences
- **Clarity Questions**: "Can you describe exactly what happened when you tried to use AI?"
- **Accuracy Questions**: "How often did this type of problem happen?"
- **Depth Questions**: "What factors made this problem difficult?"

**Multiple Choice Check**:
*What is the most important step when an AI system fails?*
A) Immediately rebuild the entire system
B) Systematically investigate what went wrong and why
C) Ignore the failure and hope it doesn't happen again
D) Blame the users for using it incorrectly

*Answer: B - Systematic investigation helps identify root causes and prevents similar failures*

#### The Unfair Hand Soap Dispenser
**Story**: "Some automatic soap dispensers use light sensors to detect hands. But if builders only tested with light-colored skin, the sensor might not 'see' hands with darker skin. That's not fair! The creators didn't mean to be unfair, but limited testing created bias."

**Bias Definition**: When AI makes unfair decisions because training data wasn't diverse enough

**Could Our Pet Detector Be Biased?**
- What if we only trained with big, fluffy dogs?
- Would it recognize small, short-haired chihuahuas?
- How do we fix bias? **More fair and diverse data!**

### Session 2: Ideate, Prototype, and Implement Solutions

#### Systematic Solution Development
**How Might We Questions**: Transform problems into solution-focused questions
- Based on evidence, How Might We address the most significant technical problems?
- How Might We meet the most important user needs?
- How Might We design for the broadest range of contexts?

**Critical Analysis of Solutions**:
- **Clarity**: Is this solution clearly defined?
- **Relevance**: Does this address our priority problems?
- **Fairness**: Does this solution treat all user groups fairly?

#### Your AI Superhero Pledge
**Responsible AI Creator Pledge**:

*"I, [Your Name], pledge to be a responsible AI superhero. I will:*

1. **Think about EVERYONE**: Make AI that is helpful and fair for people of all kinds
2. **Use Good, Diverse Data**: Train AI with wide variety of examples to prevent bias
3. **Ask for Help**: Have others test my creations to find problems I might miss
4. **Be Honest**: Let my AI say "I'm not sure!" when it doesn't know the answer
5. **Use My Powers for Good**: Use AI knowledge to solve important problems and help people"

**Multiple Choice Check**:
*What is the most important quality of a responsible AI creator?*
A) Being the smartest programmer
B) Making the most accurate AI possible
C) Thinking carefully about how AI affects all people
D) Creating the most complex systems

*Answer: C - Responsible AI creators consider the impact of their work on all people and communities*

#### Evidence-Based Improvement
**User Testing with Systematic Analysis**:
- Test AI with diverse users and situations
- Collect both quantitative data (accuracy, speed) and qualitative feedback (user satisfaction)
- Analyze performance across different user groups
- Identify patterns in mistakes and successes

#### Final Project Showcase Preparation
**Complete AI System Documentation**:
